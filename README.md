# Notifications App (React + Vite)
A fully designed and implemented *micro application* for managing notifications, built with **React** and **Vite**. This project was created as a final semester assignment and showcases both frontend development and UI design skills.

## Features

- **Display notifications**: Shows a list of notifications with the sender's name and message text.  
- **Delete single notifications**: Remove individual notifications from the list.  
- **Clear all notifications**: Quickly remove all notifications at once.  
- **Notification count**: Displays the total number of notifications.  
- **Responsive design**: Works smoothly across different screen sizes.  

## Tech Stack

- **React** – for building the user interface.  
- **Vite** – for fast development and bundling.  
- **CSS / Custom Styling** – fully styled by me, no external CSS frameworks used.
